2048_Quick-Solve
=============

This project provides an algorithm to solve the popular game 2048: http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/

This algorithm represent significant effiency improvements when compared to earlier version of the algorithm.

The idea is based on the + operator.

Up to now, + operator seems to be promising.

I have found that using this operator simplifies the game.
